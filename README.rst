About HPVsim
------------
HPVsim is a flexible agent-based model for simulation HPV transmission and progression through cervical disease to cancer. The model can be parameterized with country-specific vital dynamics, structured sexual networks, co-transmitting HPV genotypes, B- and T-cell mediated immunity, and high-resolution disease natural history. HPVsim is designed with a user-first lens: it is implemented in pure Python, has built-in tools for simulating commonly-used interventions, has been extensively tested and documented, and runs in a matter of seconds to minutes on a laptop.

In mid-2025, version 3.0 of HPVsim will be released, built on the Starsim `Starsim <https://starsim.org/>`_ modeling architecture. Since this represents a significant shift, version 3.0 and above will live in a `separate repository <https://github.com/starsimhub/hpvsim>`_. The code in this repository will be frozen after version 2.2, aside from any critical bugfixes.

The scientific paper describing HPVsim is available at https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012181. The recommended citation is:

Background
----------

HPVsim has been used for analyses in several countries. Academic papers that have been written using HPVsim include:

2. **HPV DNA Screening and Vaccination Strategies in Tunisia** (2025). Lahdhiri A, Benzina B, Ennaifer E, Tounsi H, Gzara A, Rammeh-Rommani S, Laraj O, Arfaoui H, Stuart RM Kebir, A, BenMiled S (2025). *Sci Rep*, forthcoming. 

3. **Can pruning improve agent-based modelsâ€™ calibration? An application to HPVsim** (2025). Sturman F, Swallow B, Kerr CC, Stuart RM, Panovska-Griffiths J. *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, forthcoming.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is simply via pip: ``pip install hpvsim``. Alternatively, you can clone this repository, then run ``pip install -e .`` (don't forget the dot!) in this folder to install ``hpvsim`` and its dependencies. This will make ``hpvsim`` available on the Python path. The first time HPVsim is imported, it will automatically download the required data files (~30 MB).


Usage and documentation
-----------------------

Documentation is available at https://docs.hpvsim.org. Additional usage examples are available in the ``tests`` folder.


Contributing
------------

If you wish to contribute, please follow the Starsim style guide at: https://github.com/amath-idm/styleguide. See the code of conduct readme for more information.
